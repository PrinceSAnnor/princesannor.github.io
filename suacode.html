  "Sua" in Twi, a local Ghanaian language, literally means learn. Thus, SuaCode means "learn to code". Suacode is an online mobile-based coding course/system which aims to teach millions of students across Africa software programming in Processing. SuaCode was birthed out of the challenge of low computer ownership among students that was encountered during Nsesa Foundationâ€™s annual innovation boot camp, Project iSWEST 2017. I designed, developed and led Suacode whilst working at Nsesa Foundation, and it is still growing to reach more people in Africa. In 2019, I was awarded the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships" target="_blank">Processing Foundation Fellowship</a> in New York to develop an automatic grading system and scale Suacode to over 700 students in Africa and the diaspora.

                            I started my fellowship in March with the development of the automated grading system for SuaCode,
                            dubbed AutoGrad, and the search for partnerships to boost awareness about the launch of the SuaCode
                            cohort dubbed, SuaCode Africa. I then assembled a team of four (4) developers to assist me in AutoGrad's
                            development whilst training a team of twelve (12) African facilitators and administrators
                            around the globe&mdash;Miami, Rochester, Hanover, Chicago, San Francisco in the U.S. and  Accra, Kumasi in
                            Ghana&mdash;in preparation for the launch of SuaCode Africa. Later in April, I revamped and extended
                            the SuaCode system and curriculum and set up the Google Classroom course pages in preparation for SuaCode Africa.

                        Seven hundred and nine (709)
                        students all over Africa applied to take part in SuaCode Africa,
                        showing there is a real interest in smartphone-based coding in the region.
                        All 709 students that were conditionally admitted (admission into the main
                        program was contingent on completing the course's first two modules) were from 37 
                        countries in Africa and the diaspora, and they were 
                        invited to join the SuaCode Google Classroom course.
                        After the second module, 210 students from 27 countries were admitted
                        into the main program (Fig 1. below) with 25% being female.

                        grade the assignments in Processing, and provide relevant feedback electronically.
                       

                        Similar to previous cohorts, students read lesson notes in the Google Classroom app and wrote 
                        their code using the Android Processing Development Environment (APDE) application (Fig. 2). <br><br>

                    For each assignment submission, the students included a reflection essay describing among several 
                    things, whether the lesson and assignment were fun, challenging, etc. and the experience of coding the
                    assignment with their smartphones. They posted questions in the classroom forum and received help from the
                    facilitators and their peers.<br> <br> A total completion rate of 72% was recorded with a total of 171 out of 210 
                    students granted certificates of completion (Fig. 3).<br> <br>

                    The female pass rate (76%) was higher than the male pass rate (71%).

                    a mentoring session with a tech professional at Google.

                <p class="w3-text-black">
                    At the end of the program, 86% agreed that the in-class exercises

                    the final project, 91% agreed that they are interested in learning advanced concepts
                    in Programming and 100% agreed we inspired their interest in Programming.

                <p class="w3-text-black">
                     The challenges I faced were very variegated but they weren't unexpected.
                     From forming partnerships to publicize SuaCode Africa to eventually running the cohort
                     with a larger number of participants who speak different languages, each challenge is very
                     unique in its own way. Additionally, some features of the automatic grading system AutoGrad 
                     were still under development and I had to grade many students' assignments manually.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I addressed these challenges by making use of my connections in the UAE, US, Ghana and Nigeria
                     to gain publicity for SuaCode. Relying on Google Translate and help from collaborators from Francophone countries,
                     I was able to fix the language barrier problem. 
                    In the end, these challenges made me a better leader, programmer, instructor and researcher.
                    I learnt quite a lot about leading big projects, allocating funds and working with other organizations.
                    Generally, I have acquired a lot of experiential knowledge and broadened my perspective by leading this project.

                    There will be three cohorts of Suacode Africa each year, the next cohort would be launched in October 2019.
                    The team is designing an advanced coding course that would be piloted
                     at the end of 2019 as the next step for students from Suacode Africa. 
                    We are currently doing lots of data analysis and preparing for publications
                     on coding on smartphones and online courses. Lastly, the AutoGrad team is developing Autograd further and a new AI for the Suacode forum.
